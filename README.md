Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression and Random Forest. <br>
This project aims to tackle the challenging problem of detecting fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset. <br>
Methodologies like SMOTE for oversampling and rigorous cross-validation schemes were employed to avoid data leakage. <br>
The project showcases the importance of model selection, with Random Forest outperforming Logistic Regression, particularly in terms of precision and overall accuracy. <br>
Recommendations for future work include hyperparameter tuning and exploration of more advanced machine learning methods.
